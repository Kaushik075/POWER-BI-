# DESCRIPTION 
  As part of my internship with CodTech, I completed Task 1 by creating an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard using Power BI. I began by exploring and cleaning the sample sales dataset, ensuring proper formatting for fields like order date, region, and product categories. I then designed a visually engaging dashboard that includes key metrics such as total sales, profit, quantity sold, and average order value. I used slicers for region, category, and date to make the dashboard dynamic and user-friendly. A map visual helped display regional performance, while a bar chart highlighted top-selling products and a line chart showed monthly sales trends.

This task helped me apply data visualization skills to real-world business scenarios. By combining different visuals with filters and KPIs, I was able to present insights clearly and effectively. It gave me hands-on experience in building a dashboard that supports decision-making and performance tracking. Overall, it was a valuable learning experience that strengthened my understanding of Power BI and business intelligence reporting.
